This repository contains the packages and resources for the **MCR2 course** developed by **Manchester Robotics Ltd. (MCR2)**. The course is designed to provide students with an understanding of modern autonomous systems, combining theory and practical challenges.

## Mini Challenge 1

Mini Challenge 1 consists of two main tasks:

1. **Square Path Challenge**  
   A ROS2 node is implemented to move the robot in a 2m x 2m square using an open-loop controller. The controller is auto-tuned based on user input (either speed or time) and is designed to be robust against noise, perturbations, and nonlinearities.

2. **Path Following Challenge**  
   A second node generates and follows custom paths defined by user parameters such as waypoints, velocities, or time. It calculates the required velocities or time, checks point reachability, and publishes a custom message based on `geometry_msgs/Pose` with additional fields for velocity or time.

The code for Mini Challenge 1 is located in the `mobile_robotics` package, and can be launched using the following launch files:
- **Square Path**: `move_square.launch.py`
- **Custom Path Following**: `path_challenge.launch.py`

## Mini Challenge 2

Mini Challenge 2 builds upon the tasks from Mini Challenge 1 by incorporating **closed-loop control** using feedback from encoders. This challenge focuses on executing the same square and custom paths, but now using closed-loop velocity control and position estimation. The robot now uses velocity measurements from the **inner control loop** available on the topics `/VelocityEncL` and `/VelocityEncR`.

A **new localization node** is introduced to estimate the robotâ€™s position in real-time based on encoder feedback, significantly improving trajectory accuracy and robustness.



The implementation for Mini Challenge 2 is located in the `mobile_robotics_closed_loop` package and can be launched using the following files:
- **Closed-Loop Square Path**: `move_square.launch.py`
- **Closed-Loop Custom Path**: `move_path.launch.py`

## Puzzlebot Hardware

The Puzzlebot system is powered by the following hardware components:

- **Jetson Nano 2GB**: A small yet powerful AI computer for running ROS2 and ML applications.
- **Hackerboard (ESP32, Motor Driver)**: Used to control the robot's motors and sensors.
- **2 DC Motoreductors**: [Pololu 4824 DC Motor Driver](https://www.pololu.com/product/4824) to drive the robot's wheels.

## Software

We are using the following software for the course:

- **ROS2 Humble**: A powerful robotics framework for controlling autonomous systems.
- **Ubuntu 22.04**: The operating system running on the Jetson Nano to host ROS2.

## Links for Firmware
